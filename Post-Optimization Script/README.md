# Post-Optimization Live Script
This was the script used for re-running the FC simulation after optimizing indices with PESTO

This script also includes multiple functions dedicated to extracting qualitative/quantitative accuracy metrics from the base run of the model as well as the optimized runs

'ylong_4h' is the pre-optimized model outputs (baseline = 0.400)

'ylong_4h_b' is the pre-optimized model outputs (baseline = 0.435)

'ylong_4h_og' is the original model outputs (baseline = 0.315, with feedback enabled)

'ylong_4h_opt' is the optimized model outputs

'y4h_norm' is the corresponding data
